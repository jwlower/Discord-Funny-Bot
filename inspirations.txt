said with gusto
on today of all days
with a full mouth
said in sound mind
after a long silence
as if they had been waiting years
with the wisdom of ages
on a whim
with great confidence
with no hesitation
as the stars aligned
on the edge of brilliance
with unparalleled clarity
with a sparkle in their eye
in a moment of deep thought
with a smile that could light up the room
as if the answer was always obvious
after a brief but intense reflection
like an epiphany on a Tuesday
with the intensity of a thousand suns
like a sage in the middle of a bustling market
without a second thought
after consulting the stars
as if their words had power
with a dash of mystery
as the universe intended
with a knowing wink
as though they’d just discovered the secret to life
with the confidence of a cat
as if they had unlocked a hidden level of existence
in the calm before the storm
with a dramatic flair
